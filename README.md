# ExamCompanion
To install application, add 'ExamCompanionApp.apk' to any android device and open file for installation. Alternatively, download zip of this repo, open Android Studio, select "Open an Existing android studio project" and navigate to ExamCompanion folder. Once folder is loaded as an android project; click the green play button on the top right of the screen.

Java code: app -> src -> main -> java -> com -> ec16358 -> examcompanion
Other code I've written (xml): app -> src -> main -> res -> drawable or layout or menu.
