# ExamCompanion
To install application, add 'ExamCompanionApp.apk' to any android device and open file for installation. Alternatively, open Android Studio, select "Open an Existing android studio project" and navigate to UGP folder. 

Java code: UGP-> app -> src -> main -> java -> com -> ec16358 -> examcompanion
Other code I've written (xml): UGP-> app -> src -> main -> res -> drawable or layout or menu.
